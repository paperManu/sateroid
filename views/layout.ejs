        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `link` tags, or asynchronously
        on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
        take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

        By default, stylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
        here automatically.  Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less) are supported.
        In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
        
        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:
            
            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus

        Client-side Templates
        ========================

    		HTML templates are important prerequisites of modern, rich client applications.
        To work their magic, frameworks like Backbone, Angular, Ember, and Knockout require
        that you load these templates client-side.

        By default, your Gruntfile is configured to automatically load and precompile
        client-side JST templates in your `assets/linker/templates` folder, then
        include them here automatically.
        
        To customize this behavior to fit your needs, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:

            + Import templates from other directories
            + Use a different template engine (handlebars, jade, dust, etc.)
            + Internationalize your templates using a server-side stringfile
              before they're served.

      Client-side Javascript
      ========================

      You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
      on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can 
      take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

      By default, filesin your `assets/linker/js` folder are included here
      automatically.  Both JavaScript (.js) and CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported.
      In production, your scripts will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
      
      To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
      For example, here are a few things you could do:
          
          + Change the order of your scripts
          + Import scripts from other directories
          + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
